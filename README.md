# OPTICS-Plugin
The OPTICS plugin is a population plugin for FlowJo. It performs density-based reordering and cluster detection to extract the clusters present in a population node. The user may select what parameters they wish to cluster the data on.

The user may specify the minimum points the algorithm requires to define a cluster, and the percent drop (Î¾) that will signify the start of a new cluster. The clusters found will appear as sub-populations under the population on which the plugin was run.

## System Requirements
* Java 1.6+
* FlowJo v10.1r7

The OPTICS Plugin was developed for FlowJo v10.1r7, and will not work on earlier versions.
